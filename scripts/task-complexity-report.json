      "taskTitle": "Implement Domain Models and Database Schema",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the domain modeling task into subtasks for each major domain entity (users, products, orders, etc.), including schema definition, repository implementation, and proper indexing. Include DDD pattern implementation for each bounded context.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing proper domain models following DDD principles requires careful design. The task involves multiple collections with relationships, proper indexing for performance, and setting up both MongoDB and Redis connections with appropriate patterns."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Product CRUD and Image Upload",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the product management functionality into backend API development, S3 integration for image handling, frontend form components, and seller dashboard implementation. Include validation requirements for each component.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines standard CRUD operations with cloud storage integration for images. The complexity comes from handling image uploads to S3 with presigned URLs, implementing proper validation, and building a comprehensive seller dashboard."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Product Discovery and Search",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the product discovery system into search API implementation, frontend search components, product browsing interface, and responsive design optimization. Include performance considerations for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing text search with MongoDB indexes, category filtering, and building responsive frontend components. The complexity includes handling pagination, implementing debounced search, and ensuring mobile-first design with dark mode support."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Cart and Checkout System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the cart and checkout system into cart data model implementation, cart API endpoints, checkout process logic, order creation transaction handling, and frontend component development. Include validation requirements for each step.",
      "reasoning": "Shopping cart functionality involves maintaining cart state, implementing checkout flow with business rules (single-seller restriction), and ensuring proper stock validation. The transactional nature of order creation adds complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Order Management System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the order management system into order state machine implementation, seller order management API, buyer order history functionality, order details views, and cancellation logic. Include state transition validation for each status change.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a state machine for order status with proper validation of transitions. It requires building separate interfaces for buyers and sellers, with different capabilities for each role, and ensuring proper business rules enforcement."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Buyer-Seller Messaging System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the messaging system implementation into message data model and API endpoints, conversation threading logic, polling mechanism, and frontend messaging components. Include authorization requirements for each component.",
      "reasoning": "The messaging system requires implementing conversation threading, polling for updates, and building interactive UI components. The complexity includes ensuring proper authorization for message access and managing unread message indicators."
