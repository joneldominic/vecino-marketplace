# Title: Implement Product Discovery and Search
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build product browsing, search by keyword, and category filtering functionality.
# Details:
Create paginated product feed API with sorting options. Implement text search using MongoDB text indexes. Add category-based filtering. Build frontend components for product browsing with responsive grid layout. Implement search bar with debounced input. Create product detail page with image gallery. Ensure mobile-first responsive design as 60% of traffic is expected on phones. Implement dark mode support in the UI.

# Test Strategy:
Test search functionality with various keywords. Verify pagination works correctly. Test category filtering. Create end-to-end tests for browsing and searching products. Test responsive design on various screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create paginated product feed API with MongoDB text indexes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement backend API endpoints for retrieving paginated product data with sorting options and set up MongoDB text indexes for efficient search
### Details:
Create a RESTful API endpoint that returns paginated product data with configurable page size and page number. Implement sorting options (newest, price high-low, price low-high, popularity). Set up MongoDB text indexes on relevant product fields (name, description, tags) to support efficient text search. Include API parameters for limit, offset, sort field, and sort direction. Return appropriate metadata (total count, page info) for pagination controls.

## 2. Implement search and category filtering functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Extend the product API to support text search queries and category-based filtering
### Details:
Add text search capability to the product API using the MongoDB text indexes created earlier. Implement debouncing on the server side to prevent excessive database queries. Create category filtering logic that can be combined with text search. Support multiple category selection. Ensure search results maintain pagination and sorting capabilities. Add relevant API documentation for the new query parameters. Test search performance with various query patterns and optimize as needed.

## 3. Build responsive product browsing UI components [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create frontend components for browsing products with a responsive grid layout and search functionality
### Details:
Develop a responsive product grid component that adapts to different screen sizes (prioritize mobile-first design for 60% mobile traffic). Implement a search bar component with debounced input to prevent excessive API calls. Create category filter UI with checkboxes or dropdown menus. Build pagination controls that work well on mobile and desktop. Implement sorting controls that collapse into a dropdown on mobile. Ensure all components support dark mode through CSS variables or a theming system. Test the UI across various device sizes and orientations.

## 4. Create product detail page with image gallery [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement a detailed product view page with an image gallery and responsive layout
### Details:
Build a product detail page that displays comprehensive product information. Implement an image gallery with thumbnail navigation and lightbox functionality for enlarged views. Ensure the page layout is responsive and optimized for mobile devices. Add breadcrumb navigation showing product category hierarchy. Implement dark mode support for the detail page. Add related/similar products section at the bottom of the page. Optimize image loading with lazy loading techniques. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus states and are accessible.
