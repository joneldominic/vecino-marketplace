# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Domain Models and Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define core data models and schema for MongoDB collections following DDD principles.
# Details:
Create Mongoose schemas for users, products, orders, messages, and reviews collections as specified in the PRD. Implement repository interfaces for each domain entity. Set up MongoDB Atlas connection with proper indexes (especially text indexes for product search). Configure Redis for session store. Implement DDD patterns with bounded contexts (Catalog, Ordering, Messaging), entities/aggregates, and value objects. Set up database migration scripts.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for models and repositories with 80%+ coverage. Create integration tests that verify database operations. Test indexes for performance with sample data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Domain Bounded Contexts and Core Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the domain model structure by defining bounded contexts (Catalog, Ordering, Messaging) and core entities with their relationships following DDD principles.
### Details:
Create a domain model diagram showing bounded contexts and their relationships. Define entity classes for each context: User (shared), Product/Category (Catalog), Order/OrderItem (Ordering), Message/Conversation (Messaging), and Review (Catalog). Implement value objects for complex attributes like Address, Money, ProductSpecification. Ensure proper encapsulation of business rules within entities. Document aggregate roots and entity relationships.

## 2. Implement Mongoose Schemas and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create Mongoose schemas for all domain entities with proper validation rules, indexes, and relationships.
### Details:
Implement Mongoose schemas for users (with authentication fields, profile data), products (with text indexes for search, category references), orders (with line items, status tracking), messages (with conversation threading), and reviews (with product references). Add validation rules for each field. Create indexes for frequently queried fields. Implement schema methods for common operations. Set up text indexes for product search. Document each schema with JSDoc comments.

## 3. Create Repository Interfaces and Implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Develop repository interfaces and concrete implementations for each domain entity to abstract database operations.
### Details:
Create a base Repository interface with standard CRUD operations. Implement entity-specific repositories (UserRepository, ProductRepository, OrderRepository, MessageRepository, ReviewRepository) with specialized query methods. Use the repository pattern to abstract database access from domain logic. Implement pagination for collection queries. Add methods for complex domain-specific queries. Include transaction support for operations spanning multiple entities.

## 4. Configure Database Connections and Session Store [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Set up MongoDB Atlas connection with proper configuration and Redis for session management.
### Details:
Configure MongoDB connection with proper error handling, retry logic, and connection pooling. Set up MongoDB Atlas with appropriate security settings. Implement environment-specific configuration. Configure Redis connection for session storage with proper TTL settings. Implement health checks for both database connections. Create a database service module to manage connections. Document connection string formats and required environment variables.

## 5. Implement Database Migration and Seeding Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4
### Description: Create scripts for database migrations and initial data seeding to support development and deployment.
### Details:
Implement migration framework (like migrate-mongo) to handle schema changes. Create initial migration script to set up collections and indexes. Develop data seeding scripts for development and testing environments with sample users, products, orders, and reviews. Implement versioning for migrations. Add CLI commands to run migrations and seeds. Create documentation for database maintenance operations. Implement backup and restore procedures.
